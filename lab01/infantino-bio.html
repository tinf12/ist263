        Tommy Infantino 
        I am an Information Management and Technology interested in cyber security and project management. 
        I am a very hardworking student, and I have taken classes in Python and HTML. 
        Outside of school, I like to play sports and watch movies/TV. Some of my favorite movies are Interstellar, Knives Out, Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse, and Cars 2. The main sports I like to play are Soccer, Basketball, and Football, and I also like to go to the Gym.
