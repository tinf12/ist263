            <h2>Welcome to My Travel Blog</h2>
            <p>Hi! Welcome to my page! My name is Tommy Infantino and I am a 20 year old college student. I wanted to make this website in order to share my experiences I have been lucky enough to have. When it comes to the different places, I will be talking about my experiences there as well as having photos, and recommendations for each destination. At the end I will also have a page talking about places I hope to visit someday. Whether you are looking for inspiration for future trips or are just curios I really hope you enjoy my blog! I will be updating it as I go to more places, so stay tuned!</p>
